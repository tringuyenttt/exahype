# This is the ExaHyPE project #

## Mini installation guide ##

Copy and paste these commands to start with a working ExaHyPE application and compile the demo application _EulerFlow_:

    git clone git@gitlab.lrz.de:exahype/ExaHyPE-Engine.git
    ./ExaHyPE-Engine/Peano/checkout-update-peano.sh
    ./ExaHyPE-Engine/Toolkit/build.sh

Now you are ready to follow compile and run an ExaHyPE application [according to the guidebook](http://www5.in.tum.de/exahype/guidebook.pdf):

    cd ExaHyPE-Engine/
    java -jar Toolkit/dist/ExaHyPE.jar ApplicationExamples/EulerFlow.exahype
    cd ApplicationExamples/EulerFlow/
    
    export COMPILER=gnu
    export TBB_INC=/usr/include/tbb
    export TBB_LIB=/usr/lib/tbb
    make
    ./ExaHyPE-Euler ../EulerFlow.exahype

Look into `RUN.sh` for an alternative, more elaborate way how to setp the installation and it's dependencies. You also might want to use the `exa` tool which makes it super simple to start and use an installation from the scratch: After downloading, just execute

    exa=Miscellaneous/BuildScripts/exa.sh 
    $exa bootstrap
    $exa compile-run EulerFlow

### CodeGenerator dependencies (optional) ###

The optimised kernels are optional and can be replaced by the generic ones, thus the CodeGenerator's dependencies are also optional.

Python 3 is required to run the CodeGenerator.

Additionally the CodeGenerator requires:

* libxsmm (https://github.com/hfp/libxsmm) to generate the advanced matrix multiplication code using libxsmm's generator
* Jinja2 (https://github.com/pallets/jinja.git) a python3 template engine to generate the optimised kernel
* MarkupSafe (https://github.com/pallets/markupsafe.git), a dependency from Jinja2.

A script is provided to import all the dependencies locally

Quick installation:

    ./ExaHyPE-Engine/CodeGenerator/importDependenciesLocally.sh 

If Jinja2 is provided by your python installation you can safelly edit the value of the import script configuration parameter ``JINJA2_ALREADY_AVAILABLE`` to remove its and MarkupSafe local imports.


## General remarks ##

* Run tests before you commit
* Document your code with doxygen
* Disable auto-formatting of your IDE or follow the google code-style => `Code/Miscellaneous/.clang-format`. For Eclipse users, there is also https://github.com/wangzw/CppStyle.
* Do not run autoformatters on the DaStGen definition files (`*.def`). This will screw up the `Packed-type: ..` and `Constant: ..` lines.


## Commit guidelines ##

Please, don't commit the following:
    
* Binary files (`*.o, executables, ... `) excluding those necessary for the documentation 
* Output files (`*.vtk, logs, ... `)

Please write good commit messages that document how you changed ExaHyPE.


## Regenerate ExaHyPE's kernel gluecode ##
 
```
java -jar ~/workspace/peano/pdt/pdt.jar --generate-gluecode exahype/exahype.specification exahype ~/workspace/peano/pdt/usrtemplates:../Peano/multiscalelinkedcell
```


## Build a new release ##

I assume that the ExaHyPE release repository is checked out to ~/git/ExaHyPE-Release.


git diff HEAD master
git config --global user.email "tobias.weinzierl@durham.ac.uk"
git config --global user.name "Tobias Weinzierl"


A.1  Switch to the release branch within the ExaHyPE repository
    - Select Demonstrators:
       
git merge HEAD master

A.1. Update the guidebook
    - Change into the directory holding your guidebook and build with `make release`.
      The release target builds the PDF without annotations.
    - Copy the PDF over: `cp guidebook.pdf ~/git/ExaHyPE-Release`

A.2. Build the toolkit
    - Change into Toolkit
      `./build.sh && cp dist/* ~/git/ExaHyPE-Release`

B.1. Move it over to the release branch 

B.2. Clean-up release branch and create snapshots
  `find . -name "*.o" -delete`
  `find . -name "*.class" -delete`
  tar -czhvf ExaHyPE.tar.gz --exclude=.svn --exclude=*.o Peano ExaHyPE LICENSE.txt
  tar -czvf ExaHyPE-without-Peano.tar.gz --exclude=.svn --exclude=*.o --exclude Peano/peano --exclude Peano/tarch Peano ExaHyPE LICENSE.txt

B.3. Push

C. Make release snapshot from release branch

  git clone -b release --single-branch https://gitlab.lrz.de/exahype/ExaHyPE-Engine.git

  git push --mirror https://github.com/exahype/exahype.git
